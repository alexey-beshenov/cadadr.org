Here is some stuff that didn’t fit the other categories.

## Some old lecture notes

I typed these notes while I was a master student in Bordeaux. It goes without
saying that all possible mistakes are entirely mine. If you spot some typo or
inaccuracy, don’t hesitate to contact me.

* **p-adic numbers and Diophantine equations**,
  lectures by <a href="https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~ybilu/">Yuri Bilu</a>,
  Fall semester 2013; updated 2014-09-24.<br>
  <a href="/bordeaux-master/bilu-p-adic.pdf">PDF file</a>
  and
  <a href="https://github.com/alexey-beshenov/bilu-p-adic" class="git-link">LaTeX source</a>
* **Heights**,
  lectures by <a href="https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~fpazuki/">Fabien Pazuki</a>,
  Spring semester 2014.<br>
  <a href="/bordeaux-master/pazuki-heights.pdf">PDF file</a>
  and

## Some extra stuff

* Here’s a picture of me as an anteater, *oso hormiguero*, courtesy of the Chilean
  artist Mauro Ceballos:

* **А frequently asked question: what is CADADR?**
  It is actually a rather random word, similar to “abracadabra”, that came to my
  mind when I was looking for a domain name. It comes from a computer
  programming language named LISP, where
  `(cadadr x) = (car (cdr (car (cdr x))))`. It was not intended to sound like
  *cadavre* or anything like that and it is not my nickname either.
* Here are some of my <a href="/centroamerica/">photos from Central America</a>.
* Finally, here are [a few links that I have collected for myself](links.html).


## Some texts that I couldn’t easily find on the web

Below I share for fair use some texts that I scanned myself or found in obscure
places. I hope someone finds these useful and nobody objects.

  <a href="/docs/Artin-Verdier-1964.pdf" class="pdf-link">*Seminar on étale cohomology of number fields*</a>
