Here is my mathematical writing: PhD thesis, publications and preprints.
Any feedback is welcome!


## PhD thesis

Here is the original manuscript of my PhD thesis, advised by
[Baptiste Morin](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~bmorin/) (Université de Bordeaux)
and
[Bas Edixhoven](http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~edix/) (Universiteit Leiden),
defended in Leiden on December 10, 2018.

  of arithmetic schemes at negative integers and Weil-étale
  cohomology</a>*

For a more streamlined exposition and more complete results
(also with some corrections of minor misprints), see my preprints
[arXiv:2012.11034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11034)
and

   > **Abstract**: This is a brief, informal and very elementary
   > introduction into the work of Pila and others about counting rational
   > points on analytic and, more generally, definable sets. We also discuss
   > some of the most spectacular applications.

   >    s)$ at $s = n < 0$.

   one-dimensional arithmetic schemes at $n < 0$</a>*,
   2021, in preparation (comments are welcome).

   > **Abstract**: Let $X \to \operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}$ be an
   > arithmetic scheme (separated, of finite type) of Krull dimension
   > $1$. We write down a formula for the special value of $\zeta (X,s)$ at
   > $s = n < 0$, in terms of étale motivic cohomology of $X$ and a
   > regulator. We prove it in the case when for each generic point $\eta
   > \in X$ with char $\kappa (\eta) = 0$, the extension
   > $\kappa(\eta)/\mathbb{Q}$ is abelian. Further, we conjecture that the
   > formula holds for any one-dimensional arithmetic scheme.
