My name is Alexey Beshenov (Алексей Бешéнов), and this is my personal webpage.

Here you can find my mathematical texts, teaching materials, etc.

## About me
	      
As a mathematician, I am interested in number theory and arithmetic geometry,
zeta functions of schemes and conjectures about their special values,
in particular Lichtenbaum’s Weil-étale program.

I am also passionate about
[teaching and popularisation of mathematics](teaching/).

Here is some additional information:

* [My research statement](/cv/alexey-beshenov-research-statement.pdf) (.pdf)
  regarding Weil-étale cohomology.


## Work and education

* In 2021–2022 I will be a visiting assistant professor
  (ATER = *attaché temporaire d’enseignement et de recherche*)
  at the [GAATI Mathematics Laboratory](https://gaati.org/),
  [University of French Polynesia](https://www.upf.pf/).

* I spent 2019–2020 at [Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas](https://www.cimat.mx/)
  (CIMAT), Guanajuato, Mexico, as a visiting researcher at the group of commutative
  algebra and algebraic geometry. My hosts were Xavier Gómez Mont
  and Pedro Luis del Ángel.

* I am also interested in teaching and outreach. In 2018–2019 I took a
  “gap year” [to visit](/teaching/san-salvador/) the University of
  El&#xa0;Salvador by invitation of the Ministry of Education.

* I obtained my PhD from
  [University of Bordeaux](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) and
  [Leiden University](http://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics/)
  in 2018. I was supported by the [ALGANT](https://algant.eu/)-DOC scholarship of
  the European Union.  My supervisor in Bordeaux was
  [Baptiste Morin](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~bmorin/), and my supervisor
  in Leiden was [Bas Edixhoven](http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~edix/).

* I did my master studies in 2012–2014 in the
  [University of Milan](http://www.matematica.unimi.it/) and
  [University of Bordeaux](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/)
  under the [ALGANT program](https://algant.eu/).
  My advisor was Boas Erez.

* Before that, I obtained my first M.Sc. in theoretical computer science in
  St. Petersburg, Russia. My advisor was Dmitrii Pasechnik.

* My BSc was in programming / computer engineering.
