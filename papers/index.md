Any feedback is welcome!


## PhD thesis

Here is the original manuscript of my PhD thesis, advised by
[Baptiste Morin](https://www.math.u-bordeaux.fr/~bmorin/) (Université de Bordeaux)
and
[Bas Edixhoven](http://www.math.leidenuniv.nl/~edix/) (Universiteit Leiden),
defended in Leiden on December 10, 2018.

(also with some corrections of minor misprints), see my preprints

   > **Abstract**: This is a brief, informal and very elementary
   > introduction into the work of Pila and others about counting rational
   > points on analytic and, more generally, definable sets. We also discuss
   > some of the most spectacular applications.

   one-dimensional arithmetic schemes at strictly negative integers</a>*,
   November 2021,
   preprint [arXiv:2111.13398](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13398),
   submitted for publication.

   > **Abstract**:
   > Let $X$ be an arithmetic scheme (i.e., separated, of finite type over
   > $\operatorname{Spec} \mathbb{Z}$) of Krull dimension $1$. For the
   > associated zeta function $\zeta (X,s)$, we write down a formula for the
   > special value at $s = n < 0$ in terms of the étale motivic cohomology
   > of $X$ and a regulator. We prove it in the case when for each generic point
   > $\eta \in X$ with $\operatorname{char} \kappa (\eta) = 0$, the extension
   > $\kappa (\eta)/\mathbb{Q}$ is abelian. We conjecture that the formula holds
   > for any one-dimensional arithmetic scheme.

   > This is a consequence of the Weil-étale formalism developed by the author
   > in [arXiv:2012.11034](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11034) and

   > We also calculate the Weil-étale cohomology of one-dimensional arithmetic
   > schemes and show that our special value formula is a particular case of the
   > main conjecture from [arXiv:2102.12114](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12114).
